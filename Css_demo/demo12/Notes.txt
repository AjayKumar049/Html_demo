There may be a case when an element's content might be larger than the amount of space allocated to it. For example,
 given width and height properties do not allow enough room to accommodate the content of the element.
CSS provides a property called overflow which tells the browser what to do if the box's contents is larger than 
the box itself. This property can take one of the following values given below.
1.visible:
        Allows the content to overflow the borders of its containing element.
2.hidden:
        The content of the nested element is simply cut off at the border of the containing element and no scrollbars is visible.
3.scroll:
    The size of the containing element does not change, but the scrollbars are added to allow the user to scroll to see the content.
4.auto:
    The purpose is the same as scroll, but the scrollbar will be shown only if the content does overflow.
